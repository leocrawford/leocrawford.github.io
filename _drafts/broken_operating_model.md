Imagine two organisations. In one:

* You're **clocked into and out of work** (and indeed the toilet) to make sure you're doing your hours
* You're judged on **doing what you're told**, not solving problems
* You're considered an expendible, fungible, **human resource**, who needs to be managed and who views are irrelevant
* You're told where to sit and what job to do (and how to do it)
* Your **grade is the primary indicator off your worth**, and everything from the shirt you wear to the toilets you get to use indicate which "class" you are a member of
* Managers see their jobs as **achieving compliance** from their staff
* Problems are broken down into **repeatable chunks** so that low-trained staff can do them (because that's easier and cheaper than getting higher paid staff to perform menaingful tasks)
* The organisation sees its purpose as **wealth generation** for its shareholders, not for any wider service to mankind, or even its own workforce
* Performance Appraisals are a **competative sport**, with participants encouraged to fight over a few megre scraps. The scant rewards are used to crush rebelion and control behaviour
* Feedback flows in one direction: senior to juinor
* Decisions are made by "seniors" or by committees. Decisions made by "juniors" are allowed so long as they don't matter (and anyone senior to them reserve the right to change the decision at any time)
* Power is largely a factor of your **budget and the number of people** you have working for you. Increasing these is a goal in its own right
* Formal punishments are rare but **social exclusion** is applied and favours witheld to **punish non-conformance**
* Work is organised to **maximise rather than minimise the number of teams who need to be included**, because there is an incentive for each team to make themselves critical.
  * Getting each of these teams to make their contribution becomes the dominant function of the workforce  
  * Choosing which work to take on (or not) becomes a matter of politics and favour rather than priority.
* **Blame is widespread** and displaces the objective learning of lessons. In this game **integrity is a hindrence**
* **Outsiders and excluded and displays of diversity discouraged**. Remember conformance is important.

In the other:

* People choose what they work on, and how they do it
* There is no time keeping and everyone chooses when and where they work
* Managers are there to help and support people, not tell them what to do. Staff choose their managers, not the other way around.
* Feedback is seen as a gift, and flows in all directions
* Decisions and approvals are made by the people who know most about a topic. These decisions are respected by others, even when they disagree
* Formal punishments are rare, but informal punishments are even rarer. Transparancy and formalised conflict resolution mechanisms drive good behaviour, rather than weeding out bad.
* There is a genuine meritocracy with folk rewarded for their contributions, rather than who their friends are
* The organisation has a purpose that transends profit. It sees it's customers, it's shareholders, and its staff all as important stakeholders in the origanisation. Often staff are are given part ownership of the company to align interests
* Everyone has a say in how the company works. It affects everyone.
* Cooperation is widespread, competition is non-existant
* Outsiders are invited in and listened to. Information flows freely inside and outside the organisation (even between so-called "market competitors")
* People tackle work that they find meaning in.  

I hope most people see the first of these organisations as a legacy of our past that few have to endure these days. Indeed they might even see much they recognise in the second list (which is fantastic), however for most I expect the depiction of the decond organisation to be a wishy-washy aspiration. Something that sounds nice, but just won't work. Na√Øve even.

I guess the big question is how big a price do you have to pay for this oppulant existance for your staff? Do they deserve it? Can you compete with this "overhead"? What's your return on investment?
