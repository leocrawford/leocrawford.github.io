Organisations are not all the same; but most are quite similar.
There are some near constants like hierarchy, often but not always with grades
The one we recognise has a lot to do with Max Weber, and Taylor
Whilst we find it hard to imagine any other way, these were big departures from the ways organisations were run previously.
But they are not the only ways.
Options around:
* The way we make decisions
* The way money flows
* Prioritisation
* Flow of work
* Conflict resolution
*
represented in rules, norms, culture, etc.

The big quetsion today is whether we focus on the orgnisation with the people second, or the otehr way around.
In the old model (theory X) we have to decide what is best for the organisation and then get people to confotm. In theory Y we figure out what is bets for people, and because they share the purpose of the organisation they will wnat to to the right thing for the organisation. With the former you have a busienss change battle of applying managaments will (which is getting harder and harder) and in the later, you don't.

So do we need an operating model?

We already have one, every organisatio does. It is just tacit (not written down) and is transmitted culturally.  So there are two questions do we want to be explicit about it, and do we want to change it?

I'd suggest that if we think it's fit for purpose there is only marginal value in writing it down, but if we want to change it writing it down is a really helpful way to agree what we do and don't like about what we have now.
