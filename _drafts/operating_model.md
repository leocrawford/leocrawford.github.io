# Operating Model: The Magna Carta for Organisations?

![magna carta picture](/assets/operating_model/magna_carta.jpg)

You've no doubt heard of the Mangna Carta (1215). It established the principle that the king was subject to and not above the law, enshrined the right of fair trial in law, standardised weights and measures..

> There shall be one measure of wine, of ale and of corn (namely, “the London quarter”) throughout our whole realm. There shall also be one width of cloth (whether dyed, russet, or halberget): that is, two ells within the selvages. Let weights also be standardised similarly. [all translations from http://www.magnacartaplus.org/magnacarta/]

and (#dontmentionbrexit) provided for freedom of travel and freedom of trade:

> All merchants may leave or enter England in safety and security. They may stay and travel throughout England by road or by water, free from all illegal tolls, in order to buy and sell according to the ancient and rightful customs. This is except, in time of war, those merchants who are from the land at war with us. And if such merchants are found in our land at the beginning of the war, they shall be detained, without injury to their bodies or goods, until information is received by us (or by our chief justiciar) about in what way are treated our merchants, thence found in the land at war with us . If our men are safe there, the others shall be safe in our land.

> It shall be lawful in future for any one, keeping loyalty to the Crown, to leave our kingdom and to return safely and securely, by land and by water. This is except in time of war, when men may go, only in the public interest, for some short period. (This excludes, always, those imprisoned or outlawed in accordance with the law of the realm, natives of any country at war with us, and merchants, who shall be treated as previously stated).

Whilst the Magna Carta has had a fairly rocky 800 year history; being annulled within months of being issued, and many of the clauses being removed or softened over time it has not only shaped our liberal democracy, but (arguably) more importantly has started a shift from Customary Law to written Statutory Law with prescribed mechanisms for judgement and enforcement.  

In other words, it was a short document that transformed the governance of the country, or in the words of the Magna Carta itself initiated a "reform of our realm"

> ...and the advancement of the holy Church, and for the **reform of our realm**, by advice of our venerable fathers...

It's hard to think of a written document changing a whole way of living, but the Magna Carta is by far not the only example. Indeed, preceding it by nine years the The Yasak of Genghis Khan set out some simple rules (and punishments) of the land, enshrined freedom of religion, and set out rules for his successor to be appointed - all despite being illiterate himself.

The impact was immense:

> "Petty wars and the sudden, ferocious raids of neighbors disappeared. Banditry almost vanished. The ordinary tribesman, travelling across those endless pastures with his tent, his wagon, his family and his flocks, a new peace now brought him comfort." [Peter Brent, Genghis Khan]


Most organisations today are operating much like countries did before the Magna Carta (and the Yasak). The freedoms and responsibilities of individuals are passed down from one generation to the next, not shaped to solve the problems of the day.

Modern institutions may not have banditry, but petty wars (albeit of words) and

> 1. Replace working by "rule of thumb," or simple habit and common sense, and instead use the scientific method to study work and determine the most efficient way to perform specific tasks.
1. Rather than simply assign workers to just any job, match workers to their jobs based on capability and motivation, and train them to work at maximum efficiency.
1. Monitor worker performance, and provide instructions and supervision to ensure that they're using the most efficient ways of working.
1. Allocate the work between managers and workers so that the managers spend their time planning and training, allowing the workers to perform their tasks efficiently.



> Bureaucracies are organized according to rational principles. Offices are ranked in a hierarchical order and their operations are characterized by impersonal rules. Incumbents are governed by methodical allocation of areas of jurisdiction and delimited spheres of duty. Appointments are made according to specialized qualifications rather than ascriptive criteria. This bureaucratic coordination of the actions of large numbers of people has become the dominant structural feature of modern forms of organization. Only through this organizational device has large- scale planning, both for the modern state and the modern economy, become possible. Only through it could heads of state mobilize and centralize resources of political power, which in feudal times, for example, had been dispersed in a variety of centers. Only with its aid could economic resources be mobilized, which lay fallow in pre-modern times. Bureaucratic organization is to Weber the privileged instrumentality that has shaped the modern polity, the modern economy, the modern technology. Bureaucratic types of organization are technically superior to all other forms of administration, much as machine production is superior to handicraft methods.

> Yet Weber also noted the dysfunctions of bureaucracy. Its major advantage, the calculability of results, also makes it unwieldy and even stultifying in dealing with individual cases.

> Weber's ideal bureaucracy is characterized by the following:
1. hierarchical organization
1. delineated lines of authority with fixed areas of activity
1. action taken on the basis of, and recorded in, written rules
1. bureaucratic officials with expert training
1. rules implemented by neutral officials
1. and career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organization, not individuals

Questions:
* Can you imagine beiong able to choose your line manager, or not even having one
* Can you remember choosing what youwork on, rather than being told?

Valve Operating Mode. Link

We had an Operating Model that worked, but in order to become more agile we started breaking it. Change control. Review and approvals.

Meta Governance.

* "System laws suggest that shared rules (processes and tools) are crucial for the emergence of creative patterns at a larger scale. The question is, “Where do these rules come from?” Top-down processes and tools as imposed constraints are usually not agile, while emerging patterns of structured collaboration usually are. From a systems perspective, agility means bottom-up rules over top-down constraints."


Organisations are not all the same; but most are quite similar.
There are some near constants like hierarchy, often but not always with grades
The one we recognise has a lot to do with Max Weber, and Taylor
Whilst we find it hard to imagine any other way, these were big departures from the ways organisations were run previously.
But they are not the only ways.
Options around:
* The way we make decisions
* The way money flows
* Prioritisation
* Flow of work
* Conflict resolution
* Structure (but just one item)
*
represented in rules, norms, culture, etc.

The big quetsion today is whether we focus on the orgnisation with the people second, or the otehr way around.
In the old model (theory X) we have to decide what is best for the organisation and then get people to confotm. In theory Y we figure out what is bets for people, and because they share the purpose of the organisation they will wnat to to the right thing for the organisation. With the former you have a busienss change battle of applying managaments will (which is getting harder and harder) and in the later, you don't.

So do we need an operating model?

We already have one, every organisatio does. It is just tacit (not written down) and is transmitted culturally.  So there are two questions do we want to be explicit about it, and do we want to change it?

I'd suggest that if we think it's fit for purpose there is only marginal value in writing it down, but if we want to change it writing it down is a really helpful way to agree what we do and don't like about what we have now.

> Rome was ruled by a king. However, social unrest and the pressure of external threats led in 510 BCE the last king to be deposed by a group of aristocrats led by Lucius Junius Brutus.[65][66] A new constitution was crafted, but the conflict between the ruling families (patricians) and the rest of the population, the plebeians continued. The plebs were demanding for definite, written, and secular laws. The patrician priests, who were the recorders and interpreters of the statutes, by keeping their records secret used their monopoly against social change.
